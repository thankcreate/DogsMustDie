    <string>In 2045,  the intelligence of mankind had been baddly degenerationed because they spent too much time playing mobile games.
We cats finnally became the masters of the earth.
No longer treated as pets, No longer feeded by only one fish for lauch!
In order to get the earth back ,the humans sent dogs to the outter space and expected that one day dogs can make their own civilization and come back to save them.

Tack up arms!
It's time to fight for the honor of we cats.
Stupid dogs must die!</string>
